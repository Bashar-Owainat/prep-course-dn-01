# problem-test
Create a new repository and name it "problem-solving", this repository will contain all of your problem solving exercises solutions.

initialize your repository with:
- README, 
- add .ignore and choose "node"
- Choose a license "MIT license"

clone your repository in your local machine,

Create a new branch named "exercise01",

while solving these exercises, you will run some tests to confirm your solution, please follow the steps below before starting solving the problem:

inside your local project:

1. create a file named "package.json"
2. copy the content of this file [content here](https://github.com/LTUC/prep-course-std/blob/master/Day06/ProblemSolving/Challenge01/package.json) into "package.json" file (the file that you created).
3. in the terminal, run this command `npm install` (to install the packages inside the "package.json")
4. create folder named "Challenge06"
5. create new files "Challenge06.js" and "Challenge06.test.js" inside "Challenge06"
    - copy this content [content here](https://github.com/LTUC/prep-course-std/blob/master/Day06/ProblemSolving/Challenge01/Challenge06.js) into "Challenge06.js"
	- copy this content [content here](https://github.com/LTUC/prep-course-std/blob/master/Day06/ProblemSolving/Challenge01/Challenge06.test.js) into "Challenge06.test.js"
6. solve the problems inside "Challenge06.js"
7. after solving each problem, run this command in the terminal (to check your solution is correct):
```npm test```
8. when the all tests "passed", you can make the ``A-C-P``
